== Description ==

The "Custom Title and Meta Description" plugin by [Smuton.cz](https://www.ondrejsmutny.cz) is an essential tool for WordPress site owners who are serious about optimizing their content for search engines and improving their online visibility. Here are the features of the plugin and the reasons why users should incorporate it into their WordPress websites:

### Custom Title Replacement
This plugin allows users to override the default page or post title with a custom one that can be better optimized for search engines and more appealing to potential visitors. This can lead to higher click-through rates from search engine results pages.

### Meta Description Editor
A meta description is a brief summary of a page's content that search engines often display in search results. With this plugin, users can craft a compelling meta description for each post or page, which can entice searchers to click and also help with ranking for relevant keywords.

### Character Counters with Visual Progress Bars
As users type their custom titles and meta descriptions, they can see a live count of characters used. This feature ensures that titles and descriptions stay within the optimal length for search engines, which can prevent important text from being cut off in search results. The visual progress bars change color from green to orange to red as users approach or exceed the recommended character limits, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

### Ease of Use
The plugin integrates seamlessly into the WordPress editor, placing the custom fields in a convenient location on the edit screen. This ensures that the optimization process doesn't disrupt content creation workflows.

### SEO Best Practices
By allowing precise control over titles and meta descriptions, the plugin encourages users to follow SEO best practices. A well-crafted title and description can influence both search engine rankings and user engagement.

### Automatic Tag Insertion
The plugin intelligently inserts the custom titles and meta descriptions into the HTML head tag of each page or post, saving users the trouble of editing theme files or understanding complex web development concepts.

### No Configuration Required
With no complicated setup or options, users can start improving their SEO immediately after installation. This simplicity is ideal for beginners or those who prefer a plug-and-play solution.
